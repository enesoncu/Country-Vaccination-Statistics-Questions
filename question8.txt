Question 8:
Code Implementation Task: If this list would be a database table, please provide SQL query to fill in the missing daily vaccination numbers with discrete median of country as similar to question a.  
Please  provide the link to your code as answer to this question. 
Note: This time SQL equivalent is requested, and imputation value is median of each country, not minimum. Please remember filling countries with zero if they do not have any valid daily_vaccination records like Kuwait.


-- Step 1: We calculate the median daily vaccination for each country.
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_medians AS
SELECT country, MEDIAN(daily_vaccinations) AS country_median
FROM country_vaccination_stats
GROUP BY country;

-- Step 2:We update the missing daily vaccination numbers with the median value of each country.
UPDATE country_vaccination_stats AS t1
SET daily_vaccinations = COALESCE(t1.daily_vaccinations, t2.country_median)
FROM temp_medians AS t2
WHERE t1.country = t2.country
AND (t1.daily_vaccinations IS NULL OR t1.daily_vaccinations = '');

-- Step 3: We fill countries with zero if they do not have any valid daily vaccination records.
UPDATE country_vaccination_stats
SET daily_vaccinations = '0'
WHERE daily_vaccinations IS NULL;
